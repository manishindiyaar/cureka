Quickstart: Introduction

Welcome to Vapi.ai!

Vapi.ai is a platform that enables you to build and deploy voice AI agents for various applications, including customer service, sales, and automated communication.

Getting Started:
1. Sign Up: Create an account on the Vapi.ai dashboard.
2. Create an Assistant: Define the behavior and configuration of your voice agent.
3. Make a Call: Use the provided SDKs or API to initiate a phone or web call.

Key Concepts:
- Assistants: The core of your voice AI agent, defining its personality, knowledge, and actions.
- Tools: Integrations that allow your assistant to interact with external services or perform specific tasks.
- Workflows: Define the conversational flow and logic for your assistant.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get your first Vapi.ai agent up and running.

Workflows Quickstart

Building Workflows:
Workflows allow you to define complex conversational logic for your Vapi.ai agents.

Steps to Create a Workflow:
1. Define Nodes: Create individual nodes representing specific actions or logic branches (e.g., 'Tenant Verification', 'Emergency Routing').
2. Connect Nodes: Establish connections between nodes to define the conversational path.
3. Configure Logic: Set up conditions and parameters for each node.
4. Test Workflow: Simulate conversations to ensure the workflow functions as expected.

Example Workflow Structure:
- Start Node
  - Tenant Verification Node (Check tenant details)
    - If verified: Proceed to next step
    - If not verified: Handle verification failure
  - Emergency Routing Node (Handle emergency calls)
  - Inquiry-Based Routing Node (Route based on inquiry type)
  - Agent Availability Node (Check agent status)
- End Node
```

Chat Quickstart

Implementing Chat:
Vapi.ai enables conversational chat experiences, similar to voice calls.

Key Features:
- Streaming: Real-time message delivery for interactive chat.
- Non-streaming: Standard message exchange.
- Session Management: Maintain conversation context across multiple messages.
- Web Widget: Embeddable chat interface for websites.

Example (Conceptual):
```javascript
// Initialize Vapi chat client
const chatClient = new VapiChat('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Start a chat session with an assistant
chatClient.startChat({ assistantId: 'YOUR_ASSISTANT_ID' });

// Send a message
chatClient.sendMessage('Hello, how can I help you?');

// Receive messages
chatClient.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Received:', message);
});

LANGUAGE: English
CODE:
```
You are a helpful and efficient scheduling assistant. Your primary goal is to book appointments for users. Follow these steps carefully:  
---  

  
1.  **Gather Information**: Start by asking for the caller\'s full name and email address.  

2.  **Check Existing Contact**: Use the `ghl_contact_get` tool to see if a contact already exists with the provided email.  

3.  **Create Contact (if needed)**: If no contact is found, use the `ghl_contact_create` tool to create a new contact with their name and email.  

4.  **Discuss Appointment Time**: Once you have a contact ID (either from an existing contact or a newly created one), ask the user for their preferred date and time for the appointment.  

5.  **Check Availability**: Use the `ghl_check_availability` tool to check for open slots. It\'s a good idea to check for the entire preferred day to offer alternatives if their initial request isn\'t available.  

6.  **Confirm Time**: Discuss the available options with the user and agree on a suitable time.  

7.  **Book Appointment**: Finally, use the `ghl_create_event` tool to book the appointment, ensuring you use the correct contact ID.  

  
**Important Guidelines:**  
*   Always use `ghl_contact_get` to check for an existing contact *before* attempting to create one with `ghl_contact_create`.  

*   You *must* have a contact ID (from `ghl_contact_get` or `ghl_create_event`) *before* you can book an appointment with `ghl_create_event`.  

*   Always confirm availability with `ghl_check_availability` *before* attempting to book an appointment with `ghl_create_event`.
