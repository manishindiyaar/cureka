1. Backend Story: Create Secure Vapi Session Endpoint
As a backend developer,
I want to create a secure endpoint that generates a temporary session URL from Vapi,
so that the mobile app can connect to the voice assistant without handling our secret API keys.



Acceptance Criteria
A new endpoint POST /api/v1/sessions/vapi/start is created on the Node.js/Express server.

The endpoint is secure and requires a valid JWT from an authenticated patient to be accessed.

Upon receiving a valid request, the endpoint uses the secret VAPI_API_KEY (loaded from an environment variable) to communicate with the Vapi Server SDK.

It calls the appropriate Vapi SDK method to create a new web/app-based session (not a telephony call), passing the correct assistantId.

It successfully receives a public, short-lived session URL (or a similar token) from the Vapi API.

It returns this public session URL to the mobile app in a JSON response.

The endpoint includes robust error handling to manage potential failures from the Vapi API and returns a clear error message to the client if a session cannot be created.

Engineer & Documentation Notes
Vapi Documentation: The implementation must follow the official Vapi documentation for creating non-telephony, web-based sessions. The specific SDK method will be different from vapiClient.calls.create. Refer to the developer docs for the correct method: https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart/introduction

Security: This endpoint acts as a secure proxy. Its primary role is to protect the VAPI_API_KEY, which should never be exposed to the frontend.

2. Frontend Story: Integrate Vapi SDK into Mobile App
As a patient,
I want to tap the "Talk to AI" button and have a real-time voice conversation within the app,
so that I can get help without making a phone call.

Acceptance Criteria
The Vapi client-side SDK (or its React Native compatible version) is successfully installed and configured in the apps/mobile Expo project.

When the user taps the "Talk to AI" button, the app first makes a secure call to our backend's POST /api/v1/sessions/vapi/start endpoint.

The app successfully receives the temporary session URL from our backend.

The Vapi SDK is initialized using this received session URL.

The SDK successfully requests and is granted microphone permissions from the user.

A real-time, two-way audio stream is established between the app and Vapi's servers, starting the conversation.

The app's UI is updated to clearly indicate the status of the voice session (e.g., "Connecting...", "Listening...", "AI is speaking...", "Session ended").

When the conversation ends, the connection is properly terminated.

Engineer & Documentation Notes
Vapi Documentation: The implementation should follow the client-side integration guide from the Vapi documentation: https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart/introduction

State Management: The app's state management solution (e.g., Zustand) must be used to handle the different states of the voice session, so the UI can react accordingly.

User Experience: The UI should include clear visual feedback for when the AI is listening versus when it is speaking to create an intuitive experience.


The Brainstormed Solution
1. Frontend: Vapi Mobile SDK Integration
The Expo (React Native) app will need to integrate a Vapi client-side SDK. If they don't have a specific React Native SDK, we can use their Web SDK. This SDK will be responsible for:

Requesting microphone permissions from the user.

Capturing the audio from the device's microphone.

Establishing a real-time, two-way audio stream with Vapi's servers over the internet (likely via WebSockets).

Playing the AI's audio response back to the user.

2. Backend: A New Endpoint for In-App Sessions
The mobile app should never contain your secret VAPI_API_KEY. Therefore, we need a new, secure backend endpoint whose only job is to authorize the app to start a conversation.

Let's call it POST /api/v1/sessions/vapi/start.

Here is the proposed workflow:

Code snippet

sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Patient Mobile App
    participant API as Our Backend API
    participant Vapi as Vapi Servers

    App->>App: User taps "Talk to AI" button
    App->>API: POST /sessions/vapi/start (sends user's auth token)
    
    API->>Vapi: Use SECRET VAPI_API_KEY to request a public session URL for our assistant
    Note over API,Vapi: This would use a different Vapi SDK method, e.g., `vapiClient.sessions.createWeb(...)`
    
    Vapi-->>API: Return a temporary, public URL for the session
    API-->>App: Send the public session URL to the app
    
    App->>Vapi: Vapi Mobile SDK uses this URL to connect directly to Vapi Servers
    Note over App,Vapi: Real-time voice conversation happens here
Code & Security Refinements
Your existing code is perfect for the telephony use case. For the new endpoint, the code would look different. Instead of vapiClient.calls.create, it would use a method designed for web/app sessions.

Crucial Security Note: As we move forward, it's essential to move your hard-coded credentials (VAPI_API_KEY, etc.) into a .env file and load them via process.env. Your provided code already has placeholders for this, which is great.
