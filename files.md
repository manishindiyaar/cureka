Monorepo Project Structure
This structure separates your deployable applications (like the API and the user interfaces) from the shared, reusable packages of code.

Architectural Principles
This structure is based on a few key ideas:

apps/ Directory: This holds your final products. Each folder inside is a separate, deployable unit. This clearly separates the backend API from the web and mobile frontends.

packages/ Directory: This is where the power of the monorepo lies. It contains all the shared code that isn't deployed on its own but is used by the applications.

shared-types/: The single source of truth for your data structures (like User, Appointment, etc.). This prevents inconsistencies between your API and your user interfaces.

config/: Ensures that all your applications follow the same coding style and rules, keeping the entire codebase clean and consistent.
