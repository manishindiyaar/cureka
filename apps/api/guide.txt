To deploy successfully to Render:

  1. Set the build command to:
  npm install --workspace=@cureka/api
  npm run build --workspace=@cureka/api
  npx prisma generate --workspace=@cureka/api
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  2. Set the start command to:
  npm run start --workspace=@cureka/api
  3. Or use the render.yaml blueprint I created which configures it properly.
