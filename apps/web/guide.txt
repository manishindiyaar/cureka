Run your development server:

npm run dev
Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:3000
You'll see the new WeHealth minimalist login page with:

Split-screen design (login form on left, doctor image on right)
Blue/orange gradient theme
WeHealth logo
Professional medical imagery
What I've Done:
✅ Created new components:

MinimalistLogin.tsx - The new beautiful login page
WeHealthLogo.tsx - Custom WeHealth branding
✅ Updated the main app:

Modified app/page.unified.tsx to use the new MinimalistLogin instead of RoleBasedLogin
Added new color scheme to tailwind.config.js
✅ Preserved all functionality:

Same authentication logic
Same demo credentials work
Same role-based routing after login
Demo Credentials (same as before):
Doctor: anna.smith@cureka.com / doctor123
Pharmacist: charles.green@cureka.com / pharmacist123
Admin: admin@cureka.com / admin123
The Flow:
Login Page → New minimalist WeHealth design
After Login → Routes to appropriate dashboard (Doctor/Pharmacist/Admin)
All existing features → Work exactly the same
The new login page is now the default entry point while maintaining all the existing functionality of your Doctor, Pharmacist, and Admin dashboards!
